*Trade Gothic — Fashion Site Project*  
This website was built for my HTML class as a personal and creative web project. It’s a style guide for people who want to stand out,  pulling from grunge, opiumcore, and cyber aesthetics.

The site includes:
- A landing page with an eye image
- A chaotic collage-style home page of different styles 
- A collections page with 4 style categories
- A materials page focused on fabrics and textures
- A fitting page showing how clothing fit affects the look
- An about page that explains the vibe and purpose

The layout is styled with a dark theme, flicker effects, and custom CSS. It’s fully responsive for mobile devices.

I’d like to develop this concept further into a real fashion website by adding full collections under each category — with multiple outfit images, details, and styling breakdowns. In addition, I would like to create a 3D model feature for fitting and allow users to customize the mannequin like an avatar to pull inspiration.
